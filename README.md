#DungeonBot

This is a discord bot that allows users to create, sign up, view, or delete Mythic + Dungeon runs.

##Motivation

We began this project to help out our World of Warcraft guild, Ook for Brains(Dalaran).  We wanted to create an easier way to organize Mythic + Dungeon's.  Like most guilds, members asked
 others to join their dungeon group in guild chat.  While this is effective, it doesn't help those who did not see the message.  We decided that an application that interfaces with Discord,
 and a personally designed AngularJS web page, would allow us a greater amount of members doing runs for gearing.
